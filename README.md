# Project Title: Does Schooling Impact Life Expectancy?

## Project Summary

This project aims to investigate the relationship between education (schooling) and life expectancy. We explore whether education has a significant impact on life expectancy through regression analysis. The research is motivated by findings that suggest education, rather than race, is a key predictor of life expectancy.

## Background

The motivation for this project comes from a multi-institution study led by the Yale School of Medicine and the University of Alabama-Birmingham, indicating that the level of education is a strong predictor of lifespan. We aim to test hypotheses related to the correlation between education and life expectancy.

## Data Source

The dataset used for this analysis is sourced from Kaggle's Global Health Repository under the World Health Organization (WHO). It consists of 22 columns and 2938 rows, representing various predicting variables.

## Methodology and Results

- We conducted a linear regression model, revealing a positive correlation (0.73) between schooling and life expectancy.
- The analysis indicates that, on average, with every one-year increase in schooling, life expectancy increases by 2.3 years.
- Further models were run, considering control variables such as income composition of resources and alcohol consumption, showing the continued significance of schooling in influencing life expectancy.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, schooling significantly influences life expectancy, particularly in developing countries. The findings suggest that the impact of education on life expectancy is more pronounced in developing nations, where access to amenities and healthcare is closely tied to educational attainment.
